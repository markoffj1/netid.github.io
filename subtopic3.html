                This article examines how artificial intelligence in higher education affects students' well being, including mental health, how they relate to others, and their academic life.
                The authors note benefits such as how AI can support personalized learning, give mental health help, and make communication more efficient.
                But, they also raise concerns like over use of AI may lead to burnout, lonliness, stress, and weaker interpersonal skills.
                Privacy and job displacement worries can also be major concerns. The article does argue that while AI has true intentions,
                its integration must be balanced so it supports well being rather than just performance. It is relevant because the article
                directly hones in on how AI influences students' mental health, social connection, stress levels, and overall
                learning experience, showing both helpful supports as well as potential harms. It better explains the broader
                impact of AI on student and academic well being by emphasizing where AI can improve learning and where it may create
                new challenges.

                This article explores how generative AI affects student learning outcomes in higher education.
                Using both experimental data and student reflections, the article shows that AI can support strong academic
                performance when students use it to deepen their understanding rather than simply complete tasks. It
                explains that AI helps with idea generation, drafting, and organizing information, but meaningful learning
                still depends on students engaging actively with the material. The study also warns people that relying too much on AI may reduce critical
                thinking and self regulated learning skills. This article is relevant to understanding the impacts of AI on
                student well being and academic performance because it touches on how AI can improve learning when used responsibly,
                but also how misuse can diminish or dismiss important skills that contribute to students' long term academic health
                and success.
