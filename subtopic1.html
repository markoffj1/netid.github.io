                The Element451 article explains how AI is chaning education by helping both teachers and students work more effectively.
                The site describes several major benefits, including personalized learning that adjusts to each student's pace, automated tasks that reduce teacher workload,
                and AI tools that keep students more engaged through interactive activites. It also points out how AI can give teachers useful data about student progress,
                allowing them to offer support quicker. Another main point is that AI can expand access to learning by helping students with disabilities or those underfunded areas through features
                like translatioin, speech recognition, and instant feedback. The article also notes challenges such as data privacy and the cost of new technology.
                The information is relevant because it clearly shows how AI can make education more efficient, inclusive, and responsive when used responsibly.
