                This study reports on how professors and higher education teachers view the risks of using AI in higher education.
                Based on interviews with 40 professors from the Czech Republic and Iraq, the research reveals worries about privacy breaches, data misuse, and academic dishonesty like plagiarism.
                Many teachers and professors doubt the reilability of AI generated content and feel as though it could weaken students' critical thinking skills.
                There is also major concern that AI may replace some teacher roles or lower the amount of human interaction and connection in society. Teachers often question its ability to
                assess students' emotional or behavioral engagement and raise alarms about cybersecurity threats too.
                Although they see some value in AI for individualized learning, participants overwhelmingly call for clear ethical standards, careful use, and
                protections to keep the human side of education intact.

                This Education Week article discusses a new report from the Center for Democracy and Technology that emphasizes serious risks tied to
                the rapid rise of AI usage in K-12 schools. It points out that during the 2024-25 school year, 85% of teachers
                and 86% of students reported using AI. Half of students say it weakens their bonds with their teachers, and nearly half of the parents
                and teachers worry AI is eroding peer relationships. Critical thinking and research skills are also at an all time low
                of 70% being teachers who have expressed concern that AI is undermining those abilities. The report raises alarming issues like
                data security breaches, bullying, and unfair treatment. It recommends stronger AI training for educators, student AI literacy programs, and well defined school
                policies to manage those risks.
